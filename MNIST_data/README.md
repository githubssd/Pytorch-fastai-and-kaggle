### Almost Everything is explained in notebook

Multi-Layer Perceptron, MNIST
In this notebook, we will train an MLP to classify images from the MNIST database hand-written digit database.

The process will be broken down into the following steps:

*Load and visualize the data
*Define a neural network
*Train the model
*Evaluate the performance of our trained model on a test dataset!

*Before we begin, we have to import the necessary libraries for working with data and PyTorch.

```bash
# import libraries
import torch
```
